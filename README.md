This is a replacement for DTHMTLParser contained in [DTFoundation](https://github.com/Cocoanetics/DTFoundation). It is written natively in Swift as a thin wrapper around libxml2's [HTML Parser](https://opensource.apple.com/source/libxml2/libxml2-21/libxml2/doc/html/libxml-HTMLparser.html), which is Apple OpenSource.
